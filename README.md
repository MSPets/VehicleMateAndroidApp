# VehicleMateAndroidApp
This is an Android application that I started working on during university. It is designed for people who have multiple vehicles that they are struggling to keep track of. It saves notes, important information and reminds users of important deadlines.
It was my final year project and the abstract for it is below.

Abstract
Nowadays a lot of people have a collection of different vehicles that need certain work done at certain times. For example, someone might have a work car and a personal car that have two different insurances due at different times, or someone might have a car and a motorbike that both have motâ€™s on different dates. This can be exceedingly difficult to keep track off and if forgot can have serious repercussions.
Having an app that can keep track of different times and dates of vehicle-related things would be a great help for many people, not only those with a poor memory. Even if they were able to remember everything, having a reminder on their phone would be a great help and prevent a lot of panic.
People would also find it useful to know how cost-efficient their vehicles are so they can judge whether the vehicle is worth having or if an upgrade is due.
The option for a route planner can also help with peace of mind by informing the user if they will need to fill up on their way to their destination.
